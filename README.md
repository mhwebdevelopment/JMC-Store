# ðŸŽ¨ JMC Store â€” Minimalist Art Gallery Ecommerce Platform

A simple online art gallery & ecommerce platform built for gallery owners, artists, collectors, and investors. With minimal user-friendly browsing, role-based dashboards, Firebase Firestore, Stripe checkout, and Google authentication.
This was a project for a small Art Gallery in New York.

NOTE: This project was from 2022 and is no longer maintained (several security issues exist)

# Tutorial: JMC-Store

JMC-Store is an *online art gallery* where users can **browse and purchase unique paintings**. It allows talented *New York artists* to showcase their work, while administrators can **efficiently manage** the art catalog, user accounts, and artist profiles through a dedicated dashboard. All application data, including user profiles and product details, is securely stored and managed using **Firebase**, and all purchases are processed through **Stripe** for secure financial transactions.
